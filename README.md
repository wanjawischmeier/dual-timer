# Dual Timer
**Its time. For a revolution in the way we percieve the passage of time. 2 timers. One app. It's never been done before.**

The need for this arose during the Corona period, when we had to open the windows at school for 5 minutes every 15 minutes. So we sat to together and stumbled our way through the creation of our first android app. And actually ended up using it pretty extensively for the entire winter.
